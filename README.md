# jupyter-exploration

# In our second lab assignment, we delved into various aspects of GitHub, starting with the creation of a repository. Following this, we proceeded to download Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebook. Within the notebook, we created a new document, where we explained the concept of cells and included a simple print statement. Finally, we completed the task by uploading the notebook to GitHub.
